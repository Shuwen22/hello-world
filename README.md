# hello-world
This is my first repository in GitHub. I started learning how to use GitHub today. My major is economics and I found I am not interested in it at all. I am not sure whether I can do a good job in coding. I wish myself a good luck. 

I am learning with the GitHub guide. I need to write something here so that the readme-edits branch is not the same as the former one.
